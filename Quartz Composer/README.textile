h1. Build Monitors for Cruise using Quartz Composer

h3. Build Monitor Template.qtz

This is a bare-bones build monitor that's already useful out of the box. It displays all projects listed in the XML with a coloured status indicator next to them. It reads the same XML feeds as CCMenu, CCTray etc. Make sure you use those instead of the RSS feed in this case.

You may want to use this template as a starting point for new screen savers and build radiators.

h3. NES Cube.qtz

Uses an old-school NES font to display the RSS feed for a project (currently only looks nice with CruiseControl.rb + git feeds). It's badly put together at the moment and only works for one project. Let me know if you want to use it and I'll get it fixed / made more generic.

You'll need the "Press Start K font":http://www.zone38.net/font/#pressstart.
